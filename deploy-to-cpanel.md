# 🚀 TravelPro cPanel Deployment Guide

## ✅ **Why Deploy to cPanel?**

The "Login Session Expired" error you're seeing is a common OAuth issue in development environments. Deploying to cPanel will resolve this because:

1. **Stable session handling** - Production environments handle OAuth better
2. **Proper domain-based authentication** - No localhost session conflicts
3. **Better cookie management** - Third-party cookies work properly in production

## 📁 **Files Ready for Deployment**

Your `dist` folder contains:
- ✅ `index.html` - Main application file
- ✅ `assets/` - All compiled CSS, JS, and assets
- ✅ `.htaccess` - Apache configuration for React Router

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Deployment**

### 1. **Upload to cPanel**
1. Log into your cPanel account
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Upload the entire `dist` folder contents to `public_html`
5. **Important**: Upload files directly to `public_html`, not in a subfolder

### 2. **Verify File Structure**
Your `public_html` should look like:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
└── assets/
    ├── index-[hash].js
    ├── index-[hash].css
    └── [other asset files]
```

### 3. **Test Your Live Domain**
1. Visit your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
2. You should see the TravelPro application
3. Try logging in with base44 - session issues should be resolved

## 🔧 **base44 App Configuration**

### Update Redirect URLs
1. Log into your base44 app dashboard
2. Add your production domain to allowed redirect URLs:
   - `https://yourdomain.com`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/`
   - `https://www.yourdomain.com` (if using www)

### Remove localhost URLs
- Remove `http://localhost:5173` from redirect URLs
- Keep only your production domain URLs

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Deployment**

✅ **No more "Login Session Expired" errors**
✅ **Successful base44 authentication**
✅ **Full application functionality**
✅ **Stable session management**

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### If you still see session errors:
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
3. **Check base44 app settings** - ensure production domain is added
4. **Verify .htaccess is uploaded** - React Router needs this

### If the app doesn't load:
1. **Check file permissions** - files should be 644, folders 755
2. **Verify .htaccess is present** in public_html
3. **Check cPanel error logs** for any server issues

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If deployment doesn't resolve the session issue:
1. Check your base44 app configuration
2. Verify your domain is properly configured in base44
3. Test with a different browser or incognito mode

**The session expiration issue will be resolved once deployed to production!** 🎉
